# Subway Ordering System

The application will be an automated Ordering System for Subway. It will use a GUI to interact with the user. A user chooses:

Size of sandwich
Type of bread
Type of meat
Type of cheese
Up to three veggies
Type of Sauce
Salt & Pepper (Y/N)
A summary display shows all of the options chosen by the user.

## Example Output

This image will display as your example output. Name the image README.jpg in your project folder.

## Analysis Steps

We analyzed the requirements by looking at the list given to us on the canvas page. We know that
we need to create a GUI and to create various functions to make our program function like a subway ordering system
we have to use multiple different javafx functions in order to build this project.

### Design



```
Give examples
```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
