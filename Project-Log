Description: Create a Subway Order System

The project progressed smoothly and it turned out to work pretty well, we didn't have any issues coding
this project as we had the internet and the online book to our advantage to help us program this assignment.
The start of our work on the project began with our wireframe that is in the repo, one of us decided to make the wireframe
and present it to the rest of the group, we all agreed that the design looked good and simple and we decided to make the GUI
based on that wireframe. Next came the UML documents, one of us created the document and created two seperate diagrams, first we created
a class diagram and then an object diagram to show more detail for the program, we all agreed it was a good UML and we stuck with it to
map out our program. Next came the discussion of who would do what within the assignment, we wanted to distribute the tasks evenly, I did Documentation
mainly a little bit of coding, while christian and Porter did the coding with Porter doing the most functions while christian did 1 or 2 functions and he also wrote
the user guide as well. Moving onto development, we began to develop this program on April 20th and finished it April 21st, it took us one day to program the project
and a little bit extra time to do documentation. The problems we encountered were very minisucule and nothing too big. Some of the minor problems we had were when we 
realized we were done coding we didn't stick to what was listed in the UML but there wasn't anything too crazy, so we were able to implement it into the project in
a short amount of time, we also had problems with time management because some of us work so we had to manage our time efficiently since we didn't start working until the 20th
and some minor logic issues but those were fixed with the help of the internet and support from the group. Now, moving onto completion steps, Joshua ending up tying the project
all together, he finished the last bit of functions that were needed regarding the viewboxes and the checkboxes, there are no bugs or problems that are still present, everything
is clean and works perfectly. All in all I think we had good teamwork during this project and we worked pretty well and communicated pretty well as a group all semester especially on this project.
