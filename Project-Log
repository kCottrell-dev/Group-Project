Description: Create a Subway Order System

The project progressed smoothly and it turned out to work pretty well, we didn't have any issues coding
this project as we had the internet and the online book to our advantage to help us program this assignment.
The start of our work on the project began with our wireframe that is in the repo, one of us decided to make the wireframe
and present it to the rest of the group, we all agreed that the design looked good and simple and we decided to make the GUI
based on that wireframe. Next came the UML documents, one of us created the document and created two seperate diagrams, first we created
a class diagram and then an object diagram to show more detail for the program, we all agreed it was a good UML and we stuck with it to
map out our program. Next came the discussion of who would do what within the assignment, we wanted to distribute the tasks evenly, I did Documentation
mainly a little bit of coding, while christian and Porter did the coding with Porter doing the most functions while christian did 1 or 2 functions and he also wrote
the user guide as well. Moving onto development steps,
